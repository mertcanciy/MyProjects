Our project was written with Python. There is no extra library to run our code. 

At the beginning of the code there is a one line code for input file like this:
write open("...") as file

You can write input file name you want to try into this place before running the code. 

In last part of the code, there is also a one line code for output as:
write open("...") as file

You can choose any name for output file.
